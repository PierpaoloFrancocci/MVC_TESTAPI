Hi Tim

pleased to meet you,

At the moment I have implemented the call of the api in the create view.
On the lost focus of the input string you have the call of the encode
on the lost focus of the output string you have the call of the decode

You have a dropdown to select the mode of the call 
by Ajax or Controller

sorry but now you can use only the first
I will implement the controller logic during the weekend

many thanks for your consideration

Pierpaolo Francocci
